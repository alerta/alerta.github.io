# Alert Console

There are several ways to view and/or query the active and historical alerts database:

1. Alert console (web based) - version 1 in production can display up to 10,000 alerts
2. Alert treemap (web based) - experimental
3. Alert widgets (web based) - for integration into dashboards like Etsy Dashboard
4. Kibana or Logstash for elasticsearch
5. Alert query CLI tool (terminal based) - uses the REST API
6. Alert REST API - open and extensible, could be used to develop a bespoke UI
7. Mobile alert status (on hold) -- will probably just make version 2 of the full web console responsive so that it supports all screen sizes, including tablets.
