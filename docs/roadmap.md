# Alerta Roadmap

* alert console for mobiles (probably using jQuery Mobile)
* log file monitoring (review Swatch, LogSurfer and SEC)
* external notification and escalation (could integrate with something like PagerDuty)
* complex event correlation - possibly using [ESPER][1] but in the meantime, see [Simple Event Correlation](Simple-Event-Correlation)
