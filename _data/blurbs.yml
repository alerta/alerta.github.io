    Email was not designed to be used as an alert console. It is not a
    scalable solution when it comes to monitoring and alert visualisation.
    A minimal installation of Alerta can be deployed quickly and easily
    extended as monitoring requirements and confidence grow. There are
    integrations available with Prometheus, Riemann, Nagios, Zabbix, netdata,
    Sensu, Pingdom and Cloudwatch. Integrating bespoke systems is easy
    using the API or command-line tool.

  icon: fa-wrench
  text: >
    Alerts are submitted in JSON-format to an HTTP API. Alerts can be
    queried from the command-line or viewed in a slick web console
    optimized for desktop, tablet and mobile. User logins can be added
    using Google, GitHub or GitLab OAuth and programatic access is managed
    using API keys.
