    Alerta accepts alerts from the standard sources like Syslog,
    SNMP, Prometheus, Nagios, Zabbix, Sensu and netdata. Any monitoring
    tool that can trigger a URL request can be integrated easily. Anything
    that can be scripted can also send alerts using the command-line tool.
    There is already a Python SDK and other SDKs are in the pipeline. Cool.

    Most other monitoring tools enforce their view of
    the world on you. Not with Alerta. You are free to send any alert
    with any value. A single alert could be associated with multiple
    services, have any number of 'tags' in any format, and any number
    of custom attributes are allowed. Nice.

    When receiving alerts from multiple sources you can
    quickly become overwhelmed. With Alerta any alert with the same
    environment and resource is considered a duplicate if it has the
    same severity. If it has a different severity it is correlated so
    that you only see the most recent one. Awesome.
