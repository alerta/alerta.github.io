    Logged in users can manage and watch alerts that are of
    interest to them. So to make user management as simple as
    possible there is built-in support for OAuth, SAML2 and LDAP user logins using
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect">Google</a>,
    <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/">GitHub</a>,
    <a href="http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/oauth_provider.html">GitLab</a> and
    <a href="https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/authorization_services/index.html">Keycloak</a>
    as well as Basic Auth for situations where OAuth isn't available.

    querying for alerts. Any alerts sent to the API using the
    explorer can be viewed in the explorer or the
    <a href="http://try.alerta.io/">web console</a> available

    Manage multiple customers using a single instance of Alerta
    via <a href="http://docs.alerta.io/en/latest/customerviews.html">customer views.</a>
