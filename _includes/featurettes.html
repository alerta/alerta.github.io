          <h2 class="featurette-heading">All the alerts. <span class="text-muted">Not just the easy ones.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Alerta accepts alerts from the standard sources like Syslog,
            SNMP, Prometheus, Nagios, Zabbix, Sensu and netdata. Any monitoring
            tool that can trigger a URL request can be integrated easily. Anything
            that can be scripted can also send alerts using the command-line tool.
            There is already a Python SDK and other SDKs are in the pipeline. Cool.</p>

          <p class="lead">Most other monitoring tools enforce their view of
            the world on you. Not with Alerta. You are free to send any alert
            with any value. A single alert could be associated with multiple
            services, have any number of 'tags' in any format, and any number
            of custom attributes are allowed. Nice.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">De-duplication and simple correlation. <span class="text-muted">Out of the box.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">When receiving alerts from multiple sources you can
            quickly become overwhelmed. With Alerta any alert with the same
            environment and resource is considered a duplicate if it has the
            same severity. If it has a different severity it is correlated so
            that you only see the most recent one. Awesome.</p>
